The game is played as follows:  
• Roll a six-sided die. 
• If you roll a 1, 2 or a 3, the game is over. 
• If you roll a 4, 5, or 6, you win that many dollars ($4, $5, or $6), and then roll again. 
• With each additional roll, you have the chance to win more money, or you might roll a 
game-ending 1, 2, or 3, at which time the game is over, and you keep whatever winnings 
you have accumulated. 
Use the randint() function from Python's Random module to get a die roll result, specifically look 
at the functions for integers. 
Set  your  code  to  run  10,000  simulations  of  the  game.  There  is  no  user  input  needed. 
Output the following statistics: 
1. the probability that a game ends with a non-zero amount (in percentages), 
2. average amount won (in currency format), and 
3. the largest amount won (in currency format). 
At the end of your code answer the following questions as a comment: 
• How likely do you think it is to win at least $4? (Hint: you may argue with or without 
using the simulation outputs.) 
• Would you pay $3 for a chance to play this game? Why or why not? How about $4?
